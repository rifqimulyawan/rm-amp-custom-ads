This is AMP-FX Flying Carpet Ads Plugin for Wordpress AMPforWP

AMP FX Flying Carpet is a function that displays the child inside a container at a fixed height.

As the user scrolls through the page, it appears like a flying carpet opening up its contents (which is more) and sliding across as if peeking through a window on the page.

Just install and set and place your advertising ID (like Google Adsense) through the plugin editor! No need to overhaul the AMPforWP plugin again (ready to use).

Free to use plugin for your entire website!

Recommended tools for those of you who are managing an AMP blog and want to increase the Click Through Rate (CTR) of your website.

No need to worry about breaking Google's rules, because this has been explained in their documentation.
